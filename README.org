* icons
A collection of icons I use for the notification of my laptop config.

** Installation
*** on ArchLinux
one can use [[https://github.com/a2n-s/pkgbuilds/blob/main/x86_64/a2n-s-icons-git/PKGBUILD][my custom PKGBUILD]] as follows:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/a2n-s/pkgbuilds
cd ./pkgbuilds
./install.sh x86_64/a2n-s-icons-git

/Makefile and instructions *coming soon*/
** Usage
The icons are installed by default in ~/usr/share/icons/a2n-s-icons-git/~.

These can be used directly as they are regular images.

** Ownership.
These icons come from the internet. Diffusion and usage rights are not known for all of them.
*I do not own any of the wallpapers listed in this repo.*

If you stumble upon art or photos that you own or that you know and show that special rights have to be used to use or share them, *let me known and I will remove them immediately and without question!*"""
